# Coding Interview Tips and Tools
Technical interviews can be **difficult**, but it doesn't have to be. Everyone has their own approach to acing them. Here's my take...

## Basics

#### Proofs
Proof by Induction</br>
*  Assert the Base Case
  *  Establish a theorem that is true for some small trivial value
*  Inductive Hypothesis 
  *  The theorem is assumed to be true for all cases up to some limit k
*  Prove True for k+1th case

Proof by Counterexample</br>
* Present a case where the statement is false

Proof by Contradiction</br>
*  Assume the theorem is false
*  Show that the assumption implies that some known property is false, hence the original assumption was erroneous

#### Runtime Estimation

O(1)
O(logN)
O(N)
O(NlogN)
O(N<sup>2</sup>)
O(2<sup>N</sup>)
O(N<sup>N</sup>)
